# Day Planner
A daily calendar that allows users to save events for each hour of a standard work day. Using jQuery and Moment.js, the calendar changes colors based on the current time. Hours in the past will appear in grey, the current hour appears in red, and upcoming hours will appear in green.

There are some opportunities for further development. Next steps would include jazzing up the style a bit, simplifying the code, implementing features to automatically clear events from previous days, and adding links for users to view previous days and events.
